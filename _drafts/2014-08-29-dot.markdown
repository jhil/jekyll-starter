<h3>Dot is a one-gesture payments app for iOS built on Venmo.</h3>

<p class="body"><a href="http://neeraj.io">Neeraj Baid</a> and I built Dot in a few weeks while we were working at Venmo. Our challenge was to make an app that experimented with a new payment experience for speed and fun. Users send money by dragging their friend the desired amount and releasing. A photo is snapped and sent on release, wrapping up the entire transaction in a second or two.</p>
